               <p>Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. </p>
              
            </div>

            <div class="section col-ld4 col-md2 col-sd1">
                <p>Layout: In the desktop view     (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. </p>
                <p class="sec">section2</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section col-ld4 col-md1 col-sd1">
                <p>Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. </p>
