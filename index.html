            <p>Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. </p></div>
        <div id="section" class="col-ld4 col-md2">
            <h3>2nd section</h3><p>Layout: In the desktop view     (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. </p></div>
        <div id="section" class="col-ld4 col-md1">
            <h3>3rd section</h3><p>Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. </p></div>
